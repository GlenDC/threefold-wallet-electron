# TFchain Desktop wallet

TheTFchain desktop wallet is a full blown wallet implemented as a light client, meaning all keys and private data are stored locally but the tfchain explorers are used to access the blockchain information, the blockchain is not fully synced locally.

## Product positioning

While being a full blown wallet, it is not an official part of the TFchain product portfolio. 
This desktop wallet provides less technical users with functionality that is not yet supported in the official wallets, helps the development team explore and test  user experience, helps shape the required functionality for the light clients and serves as an example how one can develop other light clients for tfchain.
