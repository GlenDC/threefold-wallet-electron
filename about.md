# Threefold Desktop wallet

The Threefold desktop wallet is a full blown (see: feature complete) wallet implemented as a light client, meaning all keys and private data are stored locally but the blockchain explorers are used to access the blockchain information, the blockchain is not [fully] synced locally.

## Product positioning

While being a full blown (see: feature complete) wallet, it is not an official part of the tftech product portfolio.

This desktop wallet provides non-technical users with functionality that is not yet supported in the official wallet client applications. It further helps the development team explore and test user experience (UX), helps shape the required functionality for official light clients and serves as an example how one can develop other light clients for [TFChain][tfchain] and other [Rivine][rivine]-based blockchains.
